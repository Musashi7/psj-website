## Overview

**PSJ** (*Python Script in Jupiter*) is a set of Jupiter’s technologies enable user-customization for automation purpose.

When user executes an operation via Jupiter UI, a respective macro based on Python scripting language will be generated. User can use this macro for the same model, or implement advanced Python scripting for different models/specifications. In addition, a customized Python script language is also available for user to implement necessary UI to interact with end user when needed.

## Benefits

- **CAD designer** wants to do simple but repeated analysis using his/her design rule.

- **CAE engineer** wants to automate work, shorten modelling time, reduce workload and improve productivity.

- **CAE expert** with programming background wants to do advanced modelling, which required different software interaction, data read-in/written-out ability.

- **CAE company** with standard workflow wants to make its in-housed CAD-CAE automation system, from concept design to analysis report, through a Worksheet template or customized wizard. The company can build and maintain this system based on its own resource.
